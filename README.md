Project Proposal: Items Guide and Optimizer for League of Legends

Team members: Sicong Huang. Tate Song

1. Creating a repository to collect items and updates in each patch.

2. Creating another repository to collect champions’ statics and mark their primary strength.

3. Creating a class to calculate each items’ benefits (armor, attack damage, etc.) based the values

on 100 gold.

4. Creating a repository to store the data in #3 and mark each item’s first and second features.

5. Based on every champion’s primary strength to give them 10 recommendation items (boots are

not included, they are usually applied to the situation accordingly).
